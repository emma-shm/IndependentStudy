        Advances the environment by one timestep based on agent's action. Environment includes:
        - State space
        - Action space
        - Transition dynamics (how state changes from current state to new state as result of actions)
        - Reward function

        When step() is called for a given action (thrust), the method takes the action and state variables and uses the physics equations to calculate the new state of the satellite in response.
        The method then uses new state and constraint parameters to calculate reward, and a boolean indicates if the episode is done.
